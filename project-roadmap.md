### Project Roadmap: CurlDock

#### Project Objectives
1. **Simplify API Testing:**
   - Provide a user-friendly interface to create, manage, and execute `curl` scripts for testing REST APIs.
   
2. **Enhance Script Management:**
   - Store `curl` scripts in a version-controlled manner, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.
   
3. **Improve Understanding of `curl`:**
   - Convert `curl` commands into a structured, user-friendly UI, making it easier to understand and modify complex `curl` commands.
   
4. **Ensure Consistency and Portability:**
   - Leverage Docker to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring a consistent environment across different systems.

#### Project Technology
1. **Backend: Rust**
   - **Command Execution:** Use `std::process::Command` to run `curl` commands and capture their output.
   - **Web Server Framework:** Utilize Actix-web or Rocket for handling API requests and managing frontend-backend communication.
   - **Regular Expressions:** Employ the `regex` crate for parsing and manipulating `curl` commands.
   - **Configuration Management:** Use the `dotenv` crate for managing environment variables.
   - **Error Handling:** Implement `thiserror` crate for clean and idiomatic error handling.
   - **Logging:** Integrate `log` and `env_logger` crates for logging purposes.
   - **Asynchronous Processing:** Use the `tokio` crate for non-blocking I/O operations.

2. **Frontend: React**
   - **User Interface:** Develop a web-based UI using React to provide a modern and responsive interface.
   - **State Management:** Use React hooks and context for managing state within the application.
   - **Code Editor:** Integrate Monaco Editor for rendering long JSON responses and providing a rich code editing experience.
   - **HTTP Requests:** Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the backend API endpoints.
   - **UI Components:** Leverage component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design for consistent and reusable UI elements.

3. **Deployment: Docker**
   - **Containerization:** Package the entire application (backend and frontend) into a Docker container.
   - **Volume Mapping:** Allow users to map a local directory to the container to access and manage their `curl` scripts.
   - **Port Exposure:** Expose the necessary port to access the web-based UI.

#### Project's Unique Features
1. **Easy Curl Script Generation:**
   - User-friendly interface for creating `curl` commands with form fields for method, URL, headers, body, and authentication.

2. **Script Searching Capabilities:**
   - Ability to search and manage `curl` scripts within specified directories.

3. **Curl to UI Conversion:**
   - Import existing `curl` commands and convert them into a structured UI, making it easier to understand and modify.

4. **Rendering Long JSON Responses:**
   - Utilize Monaco Editor to render long JSON responses, providing syntax highlighting and a better user experience.

5. **HTML Response Rendering:**
   - Display HTML responses within an HTML frame, allowing users to view rendered HTML content directly.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Ensure the application runs seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and macOS by leveraging Docker for consistent environment setup.

7. **Minimal Dependencies:**
   - The primary requirement is Docker, making the application easy to set up and run without installing additional dependencies.

8. **Seamless Version Control Integration:**
   - While not directly integrated into the application, the use of curl scripts as both input and output allows for easy version control integration. Users can store these scripts in version-controlled directories (e.g., a 'rest-examples' folder in a backend project).

9. **User-Managed Security:**
   - The application emphasizes user responsibility for security. Users are informed that they are responsible for managing sensitive information (such as API keys) in their curl scripts and ensuring appropriate security measures.

#### Additional Notes
1. **Initial Focus:**
   - The project will start with basic functionality and gradually expand features based on user feedback and project goals.

2. **Flexible Workspace:**
   - CurlDock is designed to work with existing project structures. For example, it can be pointed to a 'rest-examples' folder in a backend project, allowing seamless integration with existing workflows.
